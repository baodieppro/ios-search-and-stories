# DuckDuckGo Search & Stories


We are excited to engage the community in the development of our [apps](https://duckduckgo.com/app)! While development on this project is currently on hold, we are working on a new project at https://github.com/duckduckgo/iOS which we will open up to contributions soon. Stay tuned!

If you are trying to contribute in other ways, that happens over at [DuckDuckHack](http://duckduckhack.com) or on [GitHub](http://github.com/duckduckgo).
